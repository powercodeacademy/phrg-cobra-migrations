# CoBRA migrations

Since Nitro is made up of components, many of which have their own unique databases, the tools Nitro Developers use to run migrations are slightly different.

You can still think of Nitro as one central data center that stores Power's information. But the technical reality is that Nitro is a collection of many smaller databases schemas that are all stitched together.

## Adding migrations to Nitro

New migration files can live in two different places:

1. If your migration is a structural change, meaning that you are adding a column or creating a new table, your migration file should live in the `db` directory in the component the associated Rails `Model` lives in. Nitro Developers may call this type of migration a "structural migration".

#### Example structural migration:

```ruby
# components/sample_component/db/migrate/20190513160100_add_breed_to_cats.rb

class AddBreedToCats < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    add_column :cats, :breed, :string
  end
end
```

2. If your migration simply adds or updates data, such as creating some new rows in an existing table or updating a field, then your migration file should live in the `db` directory on root. Nitro Developers call the root directory of `nitro-web` "Umbrella" because it holds all the components. Nitro Developers may call this type of migration a "data migration".

#### Example data migration:

```ruby
# db/migrate/20190516110430_update_cat_breeds.rb

class UpdateCatBreeds < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    Cat.in_batches do |cat|
      cat.update(breed: "Tabby")
    end
  end
end
```

When running a migration file in Umbrella, all you need to do is run `bin/rake db:migrate` on root. When running a migration file in a component, first run `bin/rake db:migrate` from the component's root directory, and then from the root directory of `nitro-web` (Umbrella). To generate a migration file in Nitro, you should still use `rails g migration <MigrationFileName>`, whether you are creating a migration for a component or for Umbrella. Just invoke this command from the correct directory.

Nitro's data gets updated daily with new records and structure. So when it comes time for you to add a new migration, you should almost always start with reseting your local database. When reseting your local db, you start by pulling down a local data dump using the `bin/rake dev:load_recent` task from Umbrella. After this finishes, you reset the local database(s) for the component(s) you are working on using `bin/rake app:db:component:reset`. This must be run from the component's root directory.

## Checking the new database structure

Instead of updating a `schema.rb` file, Nitro uses a `structure-self.sql` file convention. As the file extension implies, `structure-self.sql` are files that contain SQL that are more specific about the data they describe. These files should never be manually altered. Like the `schema.rb`, changes to these files are automated by executing migration files.
